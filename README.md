I'm planning to use the [KOReader](https://github.com/koreader/koreader) on OpenSTLinux for the software side, and a modified [epdiy](https://github.com/vroland/epdiy/) driver board for the hardware.
The first version will be using a ED060XC3 screen with a TMA340 touch screen.

Here is the test board:

based on these PCBs from [@martinberlin](https://github.com/martinberlin):
